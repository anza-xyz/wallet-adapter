[Glow](https://glow.app) is an easy-to-use, secure wallet for iOS. We have built a Safari Extension that lets you connect to dApps, sign messages, and approve transactions from the native iOS Safari app.

Right now Glow only works on mobile Safari but we are working on adding support for Android and Desktop.
